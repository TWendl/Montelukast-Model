The PBPK model for montelukast was developed with clinical pharmacokinetic data covering intravenous as well as oral administration with a dose range of 2-10mg including single dose and multiple dose clinical data, for different types of tablet formulations.

During the model fitting, the following parameters were estimated (all other parameters were fixed to reported values):

* Lipophilicity
* Specific intestinal permeability (transcellular)
* Formulation kinetics : Weibull function parameters (Dissolution shape and Dissolution time) for
  * Singular tablet
  * Sandoz tablet
  * Film-coated tablet
  * Chewable tablet

The fit resulted in an adequate description of the clinical data. Overall the model results show that the PBPK model of montelukast adequately described the data for intravenous administration for single dose. The estimated clearance values as a fraction of the reported clearance using only intravenous data resulted in a value close to 1, which allowed to fix the clearance parameters to the reported values. This was done to prevent the otherwise high correlation with the estimated absorption related parameters (dissolution kinetics for the different tablet formulations, lipophilicity and intestinal permeability during model building).
